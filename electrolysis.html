                    <h2>A Long History</h2>
                    <p>Electrolysis has a history that goes back a century, offering a time-tested method approved by the FDA as the only true permanent hair-removal solution.<br><br> 
                    Electrology is performed through the use of sophisticated electronic equipment in the hands of a skilled, trained technician. Needle-shaped epilators are used to provide a current which provides the charge necessary for the treatment of the follicle so as to prevent future hair growth. This method has been proven to be safe, precise, and, with the use of high-quality modern systems, relatively painless. Other types of hair-removal, such as shaving, waxing, or even laser hair reduction cannot claim the certitude of an FDA-backed, century-old and scientifically verified process.

                    <h2>Types of Treatment</h2>
                    <p>The time that a 'full clear' of a given area will take is of course subjective based upon individual needs. However, the process is such that permanent and unwanted hair will be eliminated with no need for touch-ups or follow-through beyond basic aftercare. A typical clearing of a less dense area, for example, might only warrant a few 15 minute appointments, while a man's beard would require several sessions of 45 minutes to an hour. However, this still beats the time spent managing unwanted body hair, to say nothing of the peace of mind that the process can provide!

                <p>Anagen is the growth phase; catagen is the regressing phase; and telogen, the resting phase. There is also a shedding phase, or exogen, that is independent of anagen and telogen in which one of several hairs that might arise from a single follicle exit. Normally up to 90% of the hair follicles are in anagen phase while, 10–14% are in telogen and 1–2% in catagen.</p><br>

                <p>The cycle's length varies on different parts of the body. For eyebrows, the cycle is completed in around 4 months, while it takes the scalp 3–4 years to finish; this is the reason eyebrow hair have a much shorter length limit compared to hair on the head. </p>
